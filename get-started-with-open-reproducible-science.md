# Climate change is impacting the way people live around the world

::: {.cell .markdown}

Higher highs, lower lows, storms, and smoke – we’re all feeling the
effects of climate change. In this workflow, you will take a look at
trends in temperature over time in Rapid City, SD.

## Get started with open reproducible science!

[Open reproducible
science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/get-started-open-reproducible-science/)
makes scientific methods, data and outcomes available to everyone. That
means that *everyone* who wants should be able to **find**, **read**,
**understand**, and **run** your workflows for themselves.

Few if any science projects are 100% open and reproducible (yet!).
However, members of the open science community have developed open
source tools and practices that can help you move toward that goal. You
will learn about many of those tools in [the Intro to Earth Data Science
textbook](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/).
Don’t worry about learning all the tools at once – we’ve picked a few
for you to get started with.

1. Open reproducible science means sharing all research details openly so anyone can understand and check the work. It ensures data and methods are easy to access and use by others. This makes science more trustworthy and easier for everyone to build upon. 
2. GitHub supports open reproducible science by letting researchers share their work online for everyone to see. They can upload their code, data, and notes, making it easy for others to use and check their work. GitHub also allows for collaboration, so scientists can work together and improve each other's research.

## What the fork?! Who wrote this?

Below is a scientific Python workflow. But something’s wrong – The code
won’t run! Your task is to follow the instructions below to **clean and
debug** the Python code below so that it runs.

> **Tip**

## Python **packages** let you use code written by experts around the world

Because Python is open source, lots of different people and
organizations can contribute (including you!). Many contributions are in
the form of **packages** which do not come with a standard Python
download.

In the cell below, someone was trying to import the **pandas package**,
which helps us to work with [**tabular data** such as comma-separated
value or csv
files](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/use-text-files/).

> **<i class="fa fa-solid fa-keyboard fa-large" aria-label="keyboard"></i>
> Your task**
>
> 1.  Correct the typo below to properly import the pandas package under
>     its **alias** pd.
> 2.  Run the cell to import pandas
>
> NOTE: **Run your code in the right **environment\*\* to avoid import
> errors\*\*
>
> We’ve created a coding **environment** for you to use that already has
> all the software and libraries you will need! When you try to run some

> **base** kernel, which should be the default option.


```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
```

Once you have run the cell above and imported `pandas`, **run the cell
below**. It is a test cell that will tell you if you completed the task
successfully. If a test cell isn’t working the way you expect, check
that you ran your code **immediately before** running the test.


```python
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS TEST CELL
points = 0
try:
    pd.DataFrame()
    points += 5
    print('\u2705 Great work! You correctly imported the pandas library.')
except:
    print('\u274C Oops - pandas was not imported correctly.')
print('You earned {} of 5 points for importing pandas'.format(points))
```

    ✅ Great work! You correctly imported the pandas library.
    You earned 5 of 5 points for importing pandas

## There are more Earth Observation data online than any one person could ever look at

[NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)
alone manages over 9PB of
data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/getting-petabytes-people-how-eosdis-facilitates-earth-observing-data-discovery-and-use).
1 PB is roughly 100 times the entire Library of Congress (a good
approximation of all the books available in the US). It’s all available
to **you** once you learn how to download what you want.

Here we’re using the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) [Access Data
Service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation)
application progamming interface (API) to request data from their web
servers. We will be using data collected as part of the Global
Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) from their [Climate Data
Online library](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) program at
NOAA.

For this example we’re requesting [daily summary data in Rapid City, CO
(station ID
USC00396947)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00396947/detail).

> **<i class="fa fa-solid fa-pencil fa-large" aria-label="pencil"></i>
> Your task:**
>
> 1.  Research the [**Global Historical Climatology Network -
>     Daily**](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html)
>     data source.
> 2.  In the cell below, write a 2-3 sentence description of the data
>     source. You should describe:
>     -   who takes the data
>     -   where the data were taken
>     -   what the maximum temperature units are
>     -   how the data are collected
> 3.  Include a citation of the data (**HINT:** See the ‘Data Citation’
>     tab on the GHCNd overview page).

2. In the data source, the data is taken by approximately 25 different sources, including WMO, Cooperative, and CoCoRaHS networks. The data were taken from over 90,000 land-based weather stations around the world. The maximum temperature units are -1.4C and the data is collected by precipitation/or temperature.

**YOUR DATA DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE** 🛎️

## You can access NCEI GHCNd Data from the internet using its API 🖥️ 📡 🖥️

The cell below contains the URL for the data you will use in this part
of the notebook. We created this URL by generating what is called an
**API endpoint** using the NCEI [API
documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation).

> **Note**
>
> An **application programming interface** (API) is a way for two or
> more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.
> It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces
> of software ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)).

However, we still have a problem - we can’t get the URL back later on
because it isn’t saved in a **variable**. In other words, we need to
give the url a name so that we can request in from Python later (sadly,
Python has no ‘hey what was that thingy I typed yesterday?’ function).

> Your task**
>
> 1.  Pick an expressive variable name for the URL. HINT: click on the
>     `Variables` button up top to see all your variables. Your new url
>     variable will not be there until you define it and run the code
> 2.  Reformat the URL so that it adheres to the [79-character PEP-8
>     line
>     limit](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length).You
>     should see two vertical lines in each cell - don’t let your code
>     go past the second line
> 3.  At the end of the cell where you define your url variable, **call
>     your variable (type out its name)** so it can be tested.


```python
rapid_url = (
    'https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1?'
    'dataset=daily-summaries'
    '&dataTypes=TOBS,PRCP'
    '&stations=USC00396947'

# DO NOT MODIFY THIS TEST CELL
resp_url = _

if type(resp_url)==str:
    points += 3
    print('\u2705 Great work! You correctly called your url variable.')
else:
    print('\u274C Oops - your url variable was not called correctly.')

if len(resp_url)==218:
    points += 3
    print('\u2705 Great work! Your url is the correct length.')
else:
    print('\u274C Oops - your url variable is not the correct length.')

print('You earned {} of 6 points for defining a url variable'.format(points))
```

    ✅ Great work! You correctly called your url variable.
    ✅ Great work! Your url is the correct length.
    You earned 6 of 6 points for defining a url variable

## **Download and get started working with NCEI data**

The `pandas` library you imported can download data from the internet
directly into a type of Python **object** called a `DataFrame`. In the
code cell below, you can see an attempt to do just this. But there are
some problems…

> **<i class="fa fa-solid fa-keyboard fa-large" aria-label="keyboard"></i>
> You’re ready to fix some code!**
>
> Your task is to:
>
> 1.  Leave a space between the `#` and text in the comment and try
>     making the comment more informative
>
> 2.  Make any changes needed to get this code to run. HINT: The
>     `my_url` variable doesn’t exist - you need to replace it with the
>     variable name **you** chose.
>
> 3.  Modify the `.read_csv()` statement to include the following
>     parameters:
>
>     -   `index_col='DATE'` – this sets the `DATE` column as the index.
>         Needed for subsetting and resampling later on
>     -   `parse_dates=True` – this lets `python` know that you are
>         working with time-series data, and values in the indexed
>         column are **date time objects**
>     -   `na_values=['NaN']` – this lets `python` know how to handle
>         missing values
>
> 4.  Clean up the code by using **expressive variable names**,
>     **expressive column names**, **PEP-8 compliant code**, and
>     **descriptive comments**

**Make sure to call your `DataFrame` by typing it’s name as the last
line of your code cell** Then, you will be able to run the test cell
below and find out if your answer is correct.


```python
# Download boulder climatology data
rapid_df= pd.read_csv(
  rapid_url,
  index_col='DATE',
  parse_dates=True,
  na_values=['NaN']
  )
rapid_df

## Plot the precpitation column (PRCP) vs time to explore the data

Plotting in Python is easy, but not quite this easy:


```python
rapid_df.plot()
```

You’ll always need to add some instructions on labels and how you want
your plot to look.

> **<i class="fa fa-solid fa-keyboard fa-large" aria-label="keyboard"></i>
> Your task:**
>
> 1.  Change `dataframe` to **your** `DataFrame` name.
> 2.  Change `y=` to the name of your **observed temperature** column
>     name.
> 3.  Use the `title`, `ylabel`, and `xlabel` parameters to add key text
>     to your plot.
> 4.  Adjust the size of your figure using `figsize=(x,y)` where `x` is
>     figure width and `y` is figure height
>
> > **HINT:** labels have to be a *type* in Python called a **string**.
> > You can make a string by putting quotes around your label, just like

```python
rapid_df.plot(

## Subsetting and Resampling

Often when working with time-series data you may want to focus on a
shorter window of time, or look at weekly, monthly, or annual summaries
to help make the analysis more manageable.

> time-series data in our Learning Portal.

For this demonstration, we will look at the last 40 years worth of data
and resample to explore a summary from each year that data were
recorded.

## Your turn: pick a new location and/or measurement to plot 🌏 📈

Below (or in a new notebook!), recreate the workflow you just did in a
place that interests you OR with a different measurement. See the
instructions above to adapt the URL that we created for Rapid City, CO
using the NCEI API. You will need to make your own new Markdown and Code
cells below this one, or create a new notebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Congratulations, you’re almost done with this coding challenge** 🤩 – now make sure that your code is *reproducible*
